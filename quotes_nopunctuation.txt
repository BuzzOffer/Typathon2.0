The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life Dont be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
If you look at what you have in life youll always have more If you look at what you dont have in life youll never have enough
If you set your goals ridiculously high and its a failure you will fail above everyone elses success
You may say Im a dreamer but Im not the only one I hope someday youll join us And the world will live as one
You must be the change you wish to see in the world
Spread love everywhere you go Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
Darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that Hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that
Do one thing every day that scares you
Well done is better than well said
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched  they must be felt with the heart
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light
Do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
Be yourself everyone else is already taken
You will face many defeats in life but never let yourself be defeated
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams Live the life youve imagined
In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game
In this life we cannot do great things We can only do small things with great love
Many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing
Life is a long lesson in humility
In three words I can sum up everything Ive learned about life it goes on
You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose 
Life is made of ever so many partings welded together
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life Dont be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Life is trying things to see if they work
